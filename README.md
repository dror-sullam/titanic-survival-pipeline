# titanic-survival-pipeline
This repository implements an end-to-end supervised learning pipeline for the Titanic survival prediction task using scikit-learn. It includes data preprocessing (imputation, one-hot encoding, scaling) with ColumnTransformer and Pipeline, model selection with GridSearchCV and K-Fold cross-validation, and evaluation using F1 and a classification report. The notebook walks through the full flow from loading data to reporting test-set performance.
